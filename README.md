# NodeBattleship

NodeBattleship is a multiplayer Battleship game made with Node.js and socket.io.
At the start of the game, five ships of different sizes are placed randomly in a 10 x 10 grid.
The players then take turns firing shots at the opponent's grid until one player has sunk all of
the opponent's ships.

# Zibri's version
Added some nice sounds.
Added the following rules:
1) ships can't be deployed all the borders, they can touch them though.
2) submarines can't be placed in the corners
3) more ships: 1x5 1x4 2x3 3x2 4x1
